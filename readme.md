## lg-web

This is an embedable looking-glass solution to allow users to run queries on your network right from your own web page.

The product is a work in progress, so APIs/methods will change.

Relies on [lg-api](https://github.com/Wintereise/lg-api) for implementing the master <-> slave relationship.
